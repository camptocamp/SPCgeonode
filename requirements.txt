# geonode==2.6.3 # TODO : upstream fixes instead of using custom branch
https://github.com/PacificCommunity/geonode/archive/spcgeonode.zip

# Overrides because of loose Geonode dependencies
GDAL~=2.0.1 # Simply missing from Geonode
six==1.10.0 # workaround for https://github.com/benjaminp/six/issues/210
transifex-client==0.12.5 # fix because 0.13.0 requires python-slugify 1.6.4 which has a bug (shadows awesome 1.6.5)
django-polymorphic~=0.9.2 # instead of django-polymorphic>=0.9.2 pulls 2.x that doesn't work with Django 1.8
